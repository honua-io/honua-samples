# honua-samples

**Runnable samples as executable evidence.**

Cross-SDK, cross-protocol samples for [Honua Server](https://github.com/honua-io/honua-server) — each one declared against the canonical capability vocabulary and executed headless in CI against a real composed server. A green sample run is a receipt, not a promise: results feed the [honua-evidence](https://github.com/honua-io/honua-evidence) capability matrix with the same standing as tests.

## Layout

```
samples/<sample-id>/
  sample.json      manifest: id, title, capability keys, SDKs used, edition required, protocols
  README.md        what it shows, how to run it locally
  src/             the sample itself (JS/TS, Python, .NET, or raw REST)
```

Rules:

- **Manifests are validated in CI** against the canonical capability key list published by honua-server — unknown keys fail the build.
- **Every sample runs headless in CI** against a composed Honua server (Community edition unless the manifest requires higher); run results are published as evidence.
- **SDKs are consumed as published packages only** (npm/NuGet/PyPI) — no source copies, no sibling project references.
- Samples that demonstrate Esri-client compatibility point at the same endpoints ArcGIS clients use, unchanged.
